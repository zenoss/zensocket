Zenoss needs to have root permissions to open some sockets, but we
don't want the zenoss scripts to be a giant security hole. 

Zensocket replaces the use of sudo in zenoss scripts.

Zensocket is run like this:

	  zensocket --listen=<port number> -- command to run

Where "$privilegedSocket" is substituted in the command strings with
the file descriptor number.

Alternatively, access to a ping socket is available like this:

	  zensocket --ping -- zenping $ARGS --fd=$privilegedSocket
